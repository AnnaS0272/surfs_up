#Module 9 Challenge - Surfs up
---

After analyzing June and December data we can observe a lot of similarities in the sample size, mean and standard deviation which leads to conclusion that the variance in the average daily temperature for the selected months is not that great and, in fact, is rather consistent. That allows us to plan similar activities for these months.

However, we can also notice that the min(bottom) temperature gets about 10 degrees F lower in December, which means more colder mornings and evenings, not good for ice scream breakfasts and our shop cash flow may be impacted. Perhaps, we need to consider fried ice-scream options (followed by low a cholestrol pill) for those chilly December mornings and evenings. :-)

NEXT STEPS:

- Further analysis of precipitation is required to get full picture of weather pattern for the months in question.
- Taking a bit more granular approach, like looking by the week and noting any variations accordingly.
- Trying to pull in other data like current tourist activity during these months, on the island and nearby islands.
